#
Use the Code node to write custom JavaScript or Python and run it as a step in your workflow.
Coding in n8n
This page gives usage information about the Code node. For more guidance on coding in n8n, refer to the
Code
section. It includes:
Reference documentation on
Built-in methods and variables
Guidance on
Handling dates
and
Querying JSON
A growing collection of examples in the
Cookbook
Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's
Code integrations
page.
Function and Function Item nodes
The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the
Function node documentation
and
Function Item node documentation
.
Usage
#
How to use the Code node.
Choose a mode
#
There are two modes:
Run Once for All Items
: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
Run Once for Each Item
: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.
JavaScript
#
The Code node supports Node.js.
Supported JavaScript features
#
The Code node supports:
Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
Writing to your browser console using
console.log
. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.
External libraries
#
If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the
Enable modules in Code node
guide.
If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:
crypto Node.js module
moment npm package
Built-in methods and variables
#
n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to
Built-in methods and variables
for more information.
The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is
$variableName
or
$methodName()
. Type
$
in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.
Keyboard shortcuts
#
The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the
list of keyboard shortcuts
.
Python
#
n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using
Pyodide
, which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the
Packages included with Pyodide
. n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.
Slower than JavaScript
The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.
Built-in methods and variables
#
n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to
Built-in methods and variables
for more information.
The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is
_variableName
or
_methodName()
. Type
_
in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.
Keyboard shortcuts
#
The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the
list of keyboard shortcuts
.
File system and HTTP requests
#
You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:
Read/Write File From Disk
HTTP Request
Coding in n8n
#
There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.
Key concepts
#
When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:
Data structure
: understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
Item linking
: learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.
Built-in methods and variables
#
n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:
Accessing specific item data
Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
Convenience variables to help with data and time
Refer to
Built-in methods and variables
for more information.
Use AI in the Code node
#
Feature availability
AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.
AI generated code overwrites your code
If you've already written some code on the
Code
tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.
To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:
In the Code node, set
Language
to
JavaScript
.
Select the
Ask AI
tab.
Write your query.
Select
Generate Code
. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the
Code
tab.

# Compare Datasets#

Integrations
Built-in nodes
Core nodes
Compare Datasets
#
The Compare Datasets node helps you compare data from two input streams.
Node parameters
#
Decide which fields to compare. In
Input A Field
, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream A. In
Input B Field
, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B.
Optional
: You can compare by multiple fields. Select
Add Fields to Match
to set up more comparisons.
Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In
When There Are Differences
, select one of the following:
Use Input A Version
to treat input stream A as the source of truth.
Use Input B Version
to treat input stream B as the source of truth.
Use a Mix of Versions
to use different inputs for different fields.
Use
Prefer
to select either
Input A Version
or
Input B Version
as the main source of truth.
Enter input fields that are exceptions to
For Everything Except
to pull from the other input source. To add multiple input fields, enter a comma-separated list.
Include Both Versions
to include both input streams in the output, which may make the structure more complex.
Decide whether to use
Fuzzy Compare
. When turned on, the comparison will tolerate small type differences when comparing fields. For example, the number 3 and the string
3
are treated as the same with
Fuzzy Compare
turned on, but wouldn't be treated the same with it turned off.
Understand item comparison
#
Item comparison is a two stage process:
n8n checks if the values of the fields you selected to compare match across both inputs.
If the fields to compare match, n8n then compares all fields within the items, to determine if the items are the same or different.
Node options
#
Use the node
Options
to refine your comparison or tweak comparison behavior.
Fields to Skip Comparing
#
Enter field names that you want to ignore in the comparison.
For example, if you compare the two datasets below using
person.language
as the
Fields to Match
, n8n returns them as different. If you add
person.name
to
Fields to Skip Comparing
, n8n returns them as matching.

]
n8n returns three items in the
Same Branch
tab. The data is the same in both branches.
If you select
Include First Match Only
, n8n returns two items, in the
Same Branch
tab. The data is the same in both branches, but n8n only returns the first occurrence of the matching "apple" items.
Understand the output
#
There are four output options:
In A only Branch
: Contains data that occurs only in the first input.
Same Branch
: Contains data that's the same in both inputs.
Different Branch
: Contains data that's different between inputs.
In B only Branch
: Contains data that occurs only in the second output.

# Date & Time#

Integrations
Built-in nodes
Core nodes
Date & Time
#
The Date & Time node manipulates date and time data and convert it to different formats.
Timezone settings
The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:
The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to
Workflow settings
for more information.
The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is
America/New York
for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using
Environment variables
. Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the
Admin dashboard
.
Date and time in other nodes
You can work with data and time in the Code node, and in expressions in any node. n8n supports Luxon to help work with date and time in JavaScript. Refer to
Date and time with Luxon
for more information.

# Error Trigger node#

Integrations
Built-in nodes
Core nodes
Error Trigger node
#
You can use the Error Trigger node to create error workflows. When another linked workflow fails, this node gets details about the failed workflow and the errors, and runs the error workflow.
Usage
#
Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.
Give the workflow a name, for example
Error Handler
.
Select
Save
.
In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:
Select
Options
>
Settings
.
In
Error workflow
, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select
Error handler
.
Select
Save
.
Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.
Note the following:
If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error Trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.

You can use the
Stop And Error
node to send custom messages to the Error Trigger.

Core nodes
Execute Command
Execute Command
#
The Execute Command node runs shell commands on the host machine that runs n8n.
Which shell runs the command?
This node executes the command in the default shell of the host machine. For example,
cmd
on Windows and
zsh
on macOS.
If you run n8n with Docker, your command will run in the n8n container and not the Docker host.
Not available on Cloud
This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.
Node parameters
#
Configure the node using the following parameters.
Execute Once
#
Choose whether you want the node to execute only once (turned on) or once for every item it receives as input (turned off).
Command
#
Enter the command to execute on the host machine. Refer to sections below for examples of running
multiple commands
and
cURL commands
.
Run multiple commands
#
Use one of two methods to run multiple commands in one Execute Command node:
Enter each command on one line separated by
&&
. For example, you can combine the change directory (cd) command with the list (ls) command using
&&
.
1
cd
bin
&&
ls
Enter each command on a separate line. For example, you can write the list (ls) command on a new line after the change directory (cd) command.
1
2
cd
bin
ls
Run cURL command
#
You can also use the
HTTP Request
node to make a cURL request.
If you want to run the curl command in the Execute Command node, you will have to build a Docker image based on the existing n8n image. The default n8n Docker image uses Alpine Linux. You will have to install the curl package.
Create a file named
Dockerfile
.
Add the below code snippet to the Dockerfile.
1
2
3
4
FROM
docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
USER
root
RUN
apk
--update
add
curl
USER
node
In the same folder, execute the command below to build the Docker image.
1
docker
build
-t
n8n-curl
Replace the Docker image you used before. For example, replace
docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
with
n8n-curl
.
Run the newly created Docker image. You'll now be able to execute ssh using the Execute Command Node.

Core nodes
Execute Sub-workflow
#
Use the Execute Sub-workflow node to run a different workflow on the host machine that runs n8n.
Node parameters
#
Source
#
Select where the node should get the sub-workflow's information from:
Database
: Select this option to load the workflow from the database by ID. You must also enter either:
From list
: Select the workflow from a list of workflows available to your account.
Workflow ID
: Enter the ID for the workflow. The URL of the workflow contains the ID after
/workflow/
. For example, if the URL of a workflow is
https://my-n8n-acct.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/abCDE1f6gHiJKL7
, the
Workflow ID
is
abCDE1f6gHiJKL7
.
Local File
: Select this option to load the workflow from a locally saved JSON file. You must also enter:
Workflow Path
: Enter the path to the local JSON workflow file you want the node to execute.
Parameter
: Select this option to load the workflow from a parameter. You must also enter:
Workflow JSON
: Enter the JSON code you want the node to execute.
URL
: Select this option to load the workflow from a URL. You must also enter:
Workflow URL
: Enter the URL you want to load the workflow from.
Workflow Inputs
#
If you select a sub-workflow using the
database
and
From list
options, the sub-workflow's input items will automatically display, ready for you to fill in or map values.
You can optionally remove requested input items, in which case the sub-workflow receives
null
as the item's value. You can also enable
Attempt to convert types
to try to automatically convert data to the sub-workflow item's requested type.
Input items won't appear if the sub-workflow's Workflow Input Trigger node uses the "Accept all data" input data mode.
Mode
#
Use this parameter to control the execution mode for the node. Choose from these options:
Run once with all items
: Pass all input items into a single execution of the node.
Run once for each item
: Execute the node once for each input item in turn.
Node options
#
This node includes one option:
Wait for Sub-Workflow Completion
. This lets you control whether the main workflow should wait for the sub-workflow's completion before moving on to the next step (turned on) or whether the main workflow should continue without waiting (turned off).

Set up and use a sub-workflow
#
This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.
Create the sub-workflow
#
Create a new workflow.
Create sub-workflows from existing workflows
You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the
Execute Sub-workflow
node. In the node, select the
Database
and
From list
options and select
Create a sub-workflow
in the list.
You can also extract selected nodes directly using
Sub-workflow conversion
in the context menu.
Optional
: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:
Select the
Options
menu >
Settings
. n8n opens the
Workflow settings
modal.
Change the
This workflow can be called by
setting.   Refer to
Workflow settings
for more information on configuring your workflows.
Add the
Execute Sub-workflow
trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled
When Executed by Another Workflow
).
Set the
Input data mode
to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:
Define using fields below
: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The
Execute Sub-workflow node
or
Call n8n Workflow Tool node
in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
Define using JSON example
: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
Accept all data
: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.
Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.
Save the sub-workflow.
Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors
If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.
Load data into sub-workflow before building
This requires the ability to
load data from previous executions
, which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.
If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:
Create the sub-workflow and add the
Execute Sub-workflow Trigger
.
Set the node's
Input data mode
to
Accept all data
or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
In the sub-workflow
settings
, set
Save successful production executions
to
Save
.
Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
Follow the steps to
load data from previous executions
.
Adjust the
Input data mode
to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.
You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.
Call the sub-workflow
#
Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.
Add the
Execute Sub-workflow
node.
In the
Execute Sub-workflow
node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.
Find your workflow ID
Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.
Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.
Save your workflow.
When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.
You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the
View sub-execution
link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.
How data passes between workflows
#
As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in
Workflow A
. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called
Workflow B
:
The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of
Workflow B
.
The last node of
Workflow B
sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in
Workflow A
.

Function and Function Item nodes
The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the
Function node documentation
and
Function Item node documentation
.
Usage
#
How to use the Code node.
Choose a mode
#
There are two modes:
Run Once for All Items
: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
Run Once for Each Item
: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.
JavaScript
#
The Code node supports Node.js.
Supported JavaScript features
#
The Code node supports:
Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
Writing to your browser console using
console.log
. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.
External libraries
#
If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the

Keyboard shortcuts
#
The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the
list of keyboard shortcuts
.
Python
#
n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using
Pyodide
, which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the
Packages included with Pyodide
. n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.
Slower than JavaScript
The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.

HTTP Request
HTTP Request node
#
The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes in n8n. It allows you to make HTTP requests to query data from any app or service with a REST API. You can use the HTTP Request node a regular node or attached to an
AI agent
to use as a
tool
.
When using this node, you're creating a REST API call. You need some understanding of basic API terminology and concepts.
There are two ways to create an HTTP request: configure the
node parameters
or
import a curl command
.
Credentials
Refer to
HTTP Request credentials
for guidance on setting up authentication.
Node parameters
#
Method
#
Select the method to use for the request:
DELETE
GET
HEAD
OPTIONS
PATCH
POST
PUT
URL
#
Enter the endpoint you want to use.
Authentication
#
n8n recommends using the
Predefined Credential Type
option when it's available. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.
Predefined credentials
#
Credentials for integrations supported by n8n, including both built-in and community nodes. Use
Predefined Credential Type
for custom operations without extra setup. Refer to
Custom API operations
for more information.
Generic credentials
#
Credentials for integrations not supported by n8n. You'll need to manually configure the authentication process, including specifying the required API endpoints, necessary parameters, and the authentication method.
You can select one of the following methods:
Basic auth
Custom auth
Digest auth
Header auth
OAuth1 API
OAuth2 API
Query auth
Refer to
HTTP request credentials
for more information on setting up each credential type.

: Select this option to put the response into a file. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in
Put Output in Field
.
JSON
: Select this option to format the response as JSON.
Text
: Select this option to format the response as plain text. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in
Put Output in Field
.
Pagination
#
Use this option to paginate results, useful for handling query results that are too big for the API to return in a single call.
Inspect the API data first
Some options for pagination require knowledge of the data returned by the API you're using. Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.
Understand pagination
Pagination means splitting a large set of data into multiple pages. The amount of data on each page depends on the limit you set.
For example, you make an API call to an endpoint called
/users
. The API wants to send back information on 300 users, but this is too much data for the API to send in one response.
If the API supports pagination, you can incrementally fetch the data. To do this, you call
/users
with a pagination limit, and a page number or URL to tell the API which page to send. In this example, say you use a limit of 10, and start from page 0. The API sends the first 10 users in its response. You then call the API again, increasing the page number by 1, to get the next 10 results.
Configure the pagination settings:
Pagination Mode
:
Off
: Turn off pagination.
Update a Parameter in Each Request
: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.
Response Contains Next URL
: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set
Next URL
.
For example setups, refer to
HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination
.
n8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:
Variable
Description
$pageCount
The pagination count. Tracks how many pages the node has fetched.
$request
The request object sent by the HTTP node.
$response
The response object from the HTTP call. Includes
$response.body
,
$response.headers
, and
$response.statusCode
. The contents of
body
and
headers
depend on the data sent by the API.
API differences
Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:
Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
The structure of the data that the API returns.
Proxy
#
Use this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.
Enter the
Proxy
the request should use.
Timeout
#
Use this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response.
Enter the
Timeout
time to wait in milliseconds.
Tool-only options
#
The following options are only available when attached to an
AI agent
as a
tool
.
Optimize Response
#
Whether to optimize the tool response to reduce the amount of data passed to the LLM. Optimizing the response can reduce costs and can help the LLM ignore unimportant details, often leading to better results.
When optimizing responses, you select an expected response type, which determines other options you can configure. The supported response types are:
JSON
#
When expecting a
JSON
response, you can configure which parts of the JSON data to use as a response with the following choices:
Field Containing Data
: This field identifies a specific part of the JSON object that contains your relevant data. You can leave this blank to use the entire response.
Include Fields
: This is how you choose which fields you want in your response object. There are three choices:
All
: Include all fields in the response object.
Selected
: Include only the fields specified below.
Fields
: A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.
Exclude
: Include all fields
except
the fields specified below.
Fields
: A comma-separated list of fields to exclude from the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.
HTML
#
When expecting
HTML
, you can identify the part of an HTML document relevant to the LLM and optimize the response with the following options:
Selector (CSS)
: A specific element or element type to include in the response HTML. Uses the
body
element by default.
Return Only Content
: Whether to strip HTML tags and attributes from the response, leaving only the actual content. This uses fewer tokens and may be easier for the model to understand.
Elements To Omit
: A comma-separated list of CSS selectors to exclude when extracting content.
Truncate Response
: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
Max Response Characters
: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.
Text
#
When expecting a generic
Text
response, you can optimize the results with the following options:
Truncate Response
: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
Max Response Characters
: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.
Import curl command
#
curl
is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.
You can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.
Import a curl command:
From the HTTP Request node's
Parameters
tab, select
Import cURL
. The
Import cURL command
modal opens.
Paste your curl command into the text box.
Select
Import
. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.

Branch execution with If and Merge nodes
#
0.236.0 and below
n8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the
v0 (legacy)
workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your
workflow settings
.
If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.
One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.
For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the
true
output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the
false
data stream.

# Transforming data#

Using n8n
Key concepts
Data
Transforming data
#
n8n uses a predefined
data structure
that allows all nodes to process incoming data correctly.
Your incoming data may have a different data structure, in which case you will need to transform it to allow each item to be processed individually.
For example, the image below shows the output of an
HTTP Request
node that returns data incompatible with n8n's data structure. The node returns the data and displays that only one item was returned.
To transform this kind of structure into the n8n data structure you can use the data transformation nodes:
Aggregate
: take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
Limit
: remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
Remove Duplicates
: identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
Sort
: organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
Split Out
: separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
Summarize
: aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

# Merge#

Integrations
Built-in nodes
Core nodes
Merge
#
Use the Merge node to combine data from multiple streams, once data of all streams is available.
Major changes in 0.194.0
The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 0.194.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document
here
.
Minor changes in 1.49.0
n8n version 1.49.0 introduced the option to add more than two inputs. Older versions only support up to two inputs. If you're running an older version and want to combine multiple inputs in these versions, use the
Code node
.
The
Mode > SQL Query
feature was also added in n8n version 1.49.0 and isn't available in older versions.
Node parameters
#
You can specify how the Merge node should combine data from different data streams by choosing a
Mode
:
Append
#
Keep data from all inputs. Choose a
Number of Inputs
to output items of each input, one after another. The node waits for the execution of all connected inputs.
Append mode inputs and output
Combine
#
Combine data from two inputs. Select an option in
Combine By
to determine how you want to merge the input data.
Matching Fields
#
Compare items by field values. Enter the fields you want to compare in
Fields to Match
.
n8n's default behavior is to keep matching items. You can change this using the
Output Type
setting:
Keep Matches
: Merge items that match. This is like an inner join.
Keep Non-Matches
: Merge items that don't match.
Keep Everything
: Merge items together that do match and include items that don't match. This is like an outer join.
Enrich Input 1
: Keep all data from Input 1, and add matching data from Input 2. This is like a left join.
Enrich Input 2
: Keep all data from Input 2, and add matching data from Input 1. This is like a right join.
Combine by Matching Fields mode inputs and output
Position
#
Combine items based on their order. The item at index 0 in Input 1 merges with the item at index 0 in Input 2, and so on.
Combine by Position mode inputs and output
All Possible Combinations
#
Output all possible item combinations, while merging fields with the same name.
Combine by All Possible Combinations mode inputs and output
Combine mode options
#
When merging data by
Mode > Combine
, you can set these
Options
:
Clash Handling
: Choose how to merge when data streams clash, or when there are sub-fields. Refer to
Clash handling
for details.
Fuzzy Compare
: Whether to tolerate type differences when comparing fields (enabled), or not (disabled, default). For example, when you enable this, n8n treats
"3"
and
3
as the same.
Disable Dot Notation
: This prevents accessing child fields using
parent.child
in the field name.
Multiple Matches
: Choose how n8n handles multiple matches when comparing data streams.
Include All Matches
: Output multiple items if there are multiple matches, one for each match.
Include First Match Only
: Keep the first item per match and discard the remaining multiple matches.
Include Any Unpaired Items
: Choose whether to keep or discard unpaired items when merging by position. The default behavior is to leave out the items without a match.
Clash Handling
#
If multiple items at an index have a field with the same name, this is a clash. For example, if all items in both Input 1 and Input 2 have a field named
language
, these fields clash. By default, n8n prioritizes Input 2, meaning if
language
has a value in Input 2, n8n uses that value when merging the items.
You can change this behavior by selecting
Options
>
Clash Handling
:
When Field Values Clash
: Choose which input to prioritize, or choose
Always Add Input Number to Field Names
to keep all fields and values, with the input number appended to the field name to show which input it came from.
Merging Nested Fields
Deep Merge
: Merge properties at all levels of the items, including nested objects. This is useful when dealing with complex, nested data structures where you need to ensure the merging of all levels of nested properties.
Shallow Merge
: Merge properties at the top level of the items only, without merging nested objects. This is useful when you have flat data structures or when you only need to merge top-level properties without worrying about nested properties.
SQL Query
#
Write a custom SQL Query to merge the data.
Example:
1
SELECT
*
FROM
input1
LEFT
JOIN
input2
ON
input1
.
name
=
input2
.
id
Data from previous nodes are available as tables and you can use them in the SQL query as input1, input2, input3, and so on, based on their order. Refer to
AlaSQL GitHub page
for a full list of supported SQL statements.
Choose Branch
#
Choose which input to keep. This option always waits until the data from both inputs is available. You can choose to
Output
:
The
Input 1 Data
The
Input 2 Data
A Single, Empty Item
The node outputs the data from the chosen input, without changing it.

Merging data streams with uneven numbers of items
#
The items passed into Input 1 of the Merge node will take precedence. For example, if the Merge node receives five items in Input 1 and 10 items in Input 2, it only processes five items. The remaining five items from Input 2 aren't processed.
Branch execution with If and Merge nodes
#
0.236.0 and below
n8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the
v0 (legacy)
workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your
workflow settings
.
If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.
One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.
For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the
true
output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the
false
data stream.

# Edit Fields (Set)#

Integrations
Built-in nodes
Core nodes
Edit Fields (Set)
#
Use the Edit Fields node to set workflow data. This node can set new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values to Google Sheets or databases.
Node parameters
#
These are the settings and options available in the Edit Fields node.
Mode
#
You can either use
Manual Mapping
to edit fields using the GUI or
JSON Output
to write JSON that n8n adds to the input data.
Fields to Set
#
If you select
Mode
>
Manual Mapping
, you can configure the fields by dragging and dropping values from
INPUT
.
The default behavior when you drag a value is:
n8n sets the value's name as the field name.
The field value contains an expression which accesses the value.
If you don't want to use expressions:
Hover over a field. n8n displays the
Fixed | Expressions
toggle.
Select
Fixed
.
You can do this for both the name and value of the field.
Keep Only Set Fields
#
Enable this to discard any input data that you don't use in
Fields to Set
.
Include in Output
#
Choose which input data to include in the node's output data.
Node options
#
Use these options to customize the behavior of the node.
Include Binary Data
#
If the input data includes binary data, choose whether to include it in the Edit Fields node's output data.
Ignore Type Conversion Errors
#
Manual Mapping only.
Enabling this allows n8n to ignore some data type errors when mapping fields.
Support Dot Notation
#
By default, n8n supports dot notation.
For example, when using manual mapping, the node follows the dot notation for the
Name
field. That means if you set the name in the
Name
field as
number.one
and the value in the
Value
field as
20
, the resulting JSON is:
1
{
"number"
:
{
"one"
:
20
}
}
You can prevent this behavior by selecting
Add Option
>
Support Dot Notation
, and setting the
Dot Notion
field to off. Now the resulting JSON is:
1
{
"number.one"
:
20
}

# Loop Over Items#

Integrations
Built-in nodes
Core nodes
Loop Over Items
#
The Loop Over Items node helps you loop through data when needed.
The node saves the original incoming data, and with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data through the
loop
output.
When the node execution completes, it combines all of the processed data and returns it through the
done
output.
When to use the Loop Over Items node
#
By default, n8n nodes are designed to process a list of input items (with some exceptions, detailed below). Depending on what you're trying to achieve, you often don't need the Loop Over Items node in your workflow. You can learn more about how n8n processes multiple items on the
looping in n8n
page.
These links highlight some of the cases where the Loop Over Items node can be useful:
Loop until all items are processed
: describes how the Loop Over Items node differs from normal item processing and when you might want to incorporate this node.
Node exceptions
: outlines specific cases and nodes where you may need to use the Loop Over Items node to manually build looping logic.
Avoiding rate limiting
: demonstrates how to batch API requests to avoid rate limits from other services.
Node parameters
#
Batch Size
#
Enter the number of items to return with each call.
Node options
#
Reset
#
If turned on, the node will reset with the current input-data newly initialized with each loop. Use this when you want the Loop Over Items node to treat incoming data as a new set of data instead of a continuation of previous items.
For example, you can use the Loop Over Items node with the reset option and an
If node
to query a paginated service when you don't know how many pages you need in advance. The loop queries pages one at a time, performs any processing, and increments the page number. The loop reset ensures the loop recognizes each iteration as a new set of data. The If node evaluates an exit condition to decide whether to perform another iteration or not.
Include a valid termination condition
For workflows like the example described above, it's critical to include a valid termination condition for the loop. If your termination condition never matches, your workflow execution will get stuck in an infinite loop.
When enabled, you can adjust the reset conditions by switching the parameter representation from
Fixed
to
Expression
. The results of your expression evaluation determine when the node will reset item processing.

Read RSS feed from two different sources
#
This workflow allows you to read an RSS feed from two different sources using the Loop Over Items node. You need the Loop Over Items node in the workflow as the RSS Feed Read node only processes the first item it receives. You can also find the
workflow
on n8n.io.
The example walks through building the workflow, but assumes you are already familiar with n8n. To build your first workflow, including learning how to add nodes to a workflow, refer to
Try it out
.
The final workflow looks like this:

Copy the workflow file above and paste into your instance, or manually build it by following these steps:

}
},
{

,
}
}
];
Add the Loop Over Items node.
Configure Loop Over Items: set the batch size to
1
in the
Batch Size
field.
Add the RSS Feed Read node.
Select
Test Workflow
. This runs the workflow to load data into the RSS Feed Read node.
Configure RSS Feed Read: map
url
from the input to the
URL
field. You can do this by dragging and dropping from the
INPUT
panel, or using this expression:
{{ $json.url }}
.
Select
Test Workflow
to run the workflow and see the resulting data.
Check that the node has processed all items
#
To check if the node still has items to process, use the following expression:
{{$node["Loop Over Items"].context["noItemsLeft"]}}
. This expression returns a boolean value. If the node still has data to process, the expression returns
false
, otherwise it returns
true
.
Get the current running index of the node
#
To get the current running index of the node, use the following expression:
{{$node["Loop Over Items"].context["currentRunIndex"];}}
.

# Manual Trigger node#

Integrations
Built-in nodes
Core nodes
Manual Trigger node
#
Use this node if you want to start a workflow by selecting
Test Workflow
and don't want any option for the workflow to run automatically.
Workflows always need a trigger, or start point. Most workflows start with a trigger node firing in response to an external event or the
Schedule Trigger
firing on a set schedule.
The Manual Trigger node serves as the workflow trigger for workflows that don't have an automatic trigger.
Use this trigger:
To test your workflow before you add an automatic trigger of some kind.
When you don't want the workflow to run automatically.
Common issues
#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Manual Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Only one 'Manual Trigger' node is allowed in a workflow
#
This error displays if you try to add a Manual Trigger node to a workflow which already includes a Manual Trigger node.
Remove your existing Manual Trigger or edit your workflow to connect that trigger to a different node.

# Wait#

Integrations
Built-in nodes
Core nodes
Wait
#
Use the Wait node pause your workflow's execution. When the workflow pauses it offloads the execution data to the database. When the resume condition is met, the workflow reloads the data and the execution continues.
Operations
#
The Wait node can
Resume
on the following conditions:
After Time Interval
: The node waits for a certain amount of time.
At Specified Time
: The node waits until a specific time.
On Webhook Call
: The node waits until it receives an HTTP call.
On Form Submitted
: The node waits until it receives a form submission.
Refer to the more detailed sections below for more detailed instructions.
After Time Interval
#
Wait for a certain amount of time.
This parameter includes two more fields:
Wait Amount
: Enter the amount of time to wait.
Wait Unit
: Select the unit of measure for the
Wait Amount
. Choose from:
Seconds
Minutes
Hours
Days
Refer to
Time-based operations
for more detail on how these intervals work and the timezone used.
At Specified Time
#
Wait until a specific date and time to continue. Use the date and time picker to set the
Date and Time
.
Refer to
Time-based operations
for more detail on the timezone used.
On Webhook Call
#
This parameter enables your workflows to resume when the Wait node receives an HTTP call.
The webhook URL that resumes the execution when called is generated at runtime. The Wait node provides the
$execution.resumeUrl
variable so that you can reference and send the yet-to-be-generated URL wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email.
When the workflow executes, the Wait node generates the resume URL and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the
$execution.resumeUrl
. This generated URL is unique to each execution, so your workflow can contain multiple Wait nodes and as the webhook URL is called it will resume each Wait node sequentially.
For this
Resume
style, set more parameters listed below.
Authentication
#
Select if and how incoming resume-webhook-requests to
$execution.resumeUrl
should be authenticated. Options include:
Basic Auth
: Use basic authentication. Select or enter a new
Credential for Basic Auth
to use.
Header Auth
: Use header authentication. Select or enter a new
Credential for Header Auth

Time-based operations
#
For the time-based resume operations, note that:
For wait times less than 65 seconds, the workflow doesn't offload execution data to the database. Instead, the process continues to run and the execution resumes after the specified interval passes.
The n8n server time is always used regardless of the timezone setting. Workflow timezone settings, and any changes made to them, don't affect the Wait node interval or specified time.

# Webhook node#

Integrations
Built-in nodes
Core nodes
Webhook
call workflow externally
get webhook URL
webhook set route parameters
Webhook node
#
Use the Webhook node to create
webhooks
, which can receive data from apps and services when an event occurs. It's a trigger node, which means it can start an n8n workflow. This allows services to connect to n8n and run a workflow.
You can use the Webhook node as a trigger for a workflow when you want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it useful for building a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint.
The webhook allows you to trigger workflows from services that don't have a dedicated app trigger node.
Workflow development process
#
n8n provides different
Webhook URL
s for testing and production. The testing URL includes an option to
Listen for test event
. Refer to
Workflow development
for more information on building, testing, and shifting your Webhook node to production.
Node parameters
#
Use these parameters to configure your node.
Webhook URLs
#
The Webhook node has two
Webhook URLs
: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.
Select
Test URL
or
Production URL
to toggle which URL n8n displays.
Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab
Test
: n8n registers a test webhook when you select
Listen for Test Event
or
Execute workflow
, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the webhook URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
Production
: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the
Executions
tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.
HTTP Method
#
The Webhook node supports standard
HTTP Request Methods
:
DELETE
GET
HEAD
PATCH
POST
PUT
Webhook max payload
The webhook maximum payload size is 16MB.
  If you're self-hosting n8n, you can change this using the
endpoint environment variable
N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX
.
Path
#
By default, this field contains a randomly generated webhook URL path, to avoid conflicts with other webhook nodes.
You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.
The
Path
field can take the following formats:
/:variable
/path/:variable
/:variable/path
/:variable1/path/:variable2
/:variable1/:variable2
Supported authentication methods
#
You can require authentication for any service calling your webhook URL. Choose from these authentication methods:
Basic auth
Header auth
JWT auth
None
Refer to
Webhook credentials
for more information on setting up each credential type.
Respond
#
Immediately
: The Webhook node returns the response code and the message
Workflow got started
.
When Last Node Finishes
: The Webhook node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node
: The Webhook node responds as defined in the
Respond to Webhook
node.
Response Code
#
Customize the
HTTP response code
that the Webhook node returns upon successful execution. Select from common response codes or create a custom code.
Response Data
#
Choose what data to include in the response body:
All Entries
: The Webhook returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
First Entry JSON
: The Webhook returns the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
First Entry Binary
: The Webhook returns the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
No Response Body
: The Webhook returns without a body.
Applies only to
Respond > When Last Node Finishes
.
Node options
#
Select

to view more configuration options. The available options depend on your node parameters. Refer to the table for option availability.
Allowed Origins (CORS)
: Set the permitted cross-origin domains. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests. Use
*
(default) to allow all origins.
Binary Property
: Enabling this setting allows the Webhook node to receive binary data, such as an image or audio file. Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to.
Ignore Bots
: Ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.
IP(s) Whitelist
: Enable this to limit who (or what) can invoke a Webhook trigger URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IP addresses outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook trigger URL.
No Response Body
: Enable this to prevent n8n sending a body with the response.
Raw Body
: Specify that the Webhook node will receive data in a raw format, such as JSON or XML.
Response Content-Type
: Choose the format for the webhook body.
Response Data
: Send custom data with the response.
Response Headers
: Send extra headers in the Webhook response. Refer to

Use query parameters
#
When creating a query to run on a MySQL database, you can use the
Query Parameters
field in the
Options
section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.
For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
[
{
"email"
:
"alex@example.com"
,
"name"
:
"Alex"
,
"age"
:
21
},
{
"email"
:
"jamie@example.com"
,
"name"
:
"Jamie"
,
"age"
:
33
}
]
You can write a query like:
1
SELECT
*
FROM
$
1
:
name
WHERE
email
=
$
2
;
Then in
Query Parameters
, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:
1
2
// users is an example table name
users
,
{{
$json
.
email
}}
